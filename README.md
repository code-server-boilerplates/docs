# Code Server Boilerplate Docs

This repository hosts the documentation site for this community project in general, including both maintainer docs and user guide.

## Stack

* GitHub as the single source of truth for filing issues and PRs for contributors
  * On our side, it mostly Guilded + Discord (bridged through Matrix), GitLab SaaS + GitHub and Notion.
* Gatsby with the [smooth-doc theme](https://smooth-doc.com) for building great site
* Vercel as static page hosting on `csb-docs.community-lores.gq`

While both Community Lores and Code Server Boilerplates are seperate projects we're working on and lives on seperate GitHub organizations, we use Netlify DNS to manage the DNS records for `community-lores.gq` domain. If you wish to buy the `lores.community` yourself and handle the domain registration stuff, [let us know](https://community-lores.gq/contact) so we can tell you what to do next.
