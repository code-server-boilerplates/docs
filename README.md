_Just an side note: we customized the badges, even the maintenance status. Don't press it or prepare to get rickrolled (not really tho)._

## Stack

* GitHub as the single source of truth for filing issues and PRs for contributors
  * On our side, it mostly Guilded + Discord + whatever you want to use (bridged through Matrix and will probably handled by Matterbridge soon), GitLab SaaS + GitHub and Notion.
* Gatsby with the [smooth-doc theme](https://smooth-doc.com) for building great site
* Vercel as static page hosting on `csb-docs.community-lores.gq` (we lied in the repo description like Linus)

While both Community Lores and Code Server Boilerplates are seperate projects we're working on and lives on seperate GitHub organizations, we use Netlify DNS to manage the DNS records for `community-lores.gq` domain. If you wish to buy the `lores.community` yourself and handle the domain registration stuff, [let us know](https://community-lores.gq/contact) so we can tell you what to do next.
