# Template Maintainer's Docs

Welcome to the template maintainer's docs! We'll start the migration process from the starter-pack repo soon.

## What's in this handbook?

* Post-repo Creation Checklist - provided as `POST_REPO_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md` file, from setting up GitHub Actions to adjusting repository settings and add branch protection.
* Release Management - how to keep your Docker images in-sync with code-server releases, as much as possible
* Reproducible Builds - reproducing Docker image builds locally or in an cloud dev environment.
